Spec-Driven Delivery\n+All work MUST begin with a feature specification that uses the provided template.\n+Every requirement MUST be testable and mapped to at least one user story with\n+acceptance scenarios. Rationale: shared understanding prevents scope drift and\n+makes progress verifiable.\n+\n+### II. Independently Testable User Stories\n+Each user story MUST be independently implementable and testable as an MVP slice.\n+Tasks MUST be organized by story to preserve this independence. Rationale: fast,\n+incremental delivery reduces integration risk.\n+\n+### III. Test-First When Tests Are Requested\n+If a spec or plan explicitly requests tests, those tests MUST be written first\n+and MUST fail before implementation proceeds. Rationale: this enforces clear\n+behavior contracts and prevents false confidence.\n+\n+### IV. Traceable Artifacts and Explicit Paths\n+Plans and tasks MUST cite exact file paths and reference the user story or\n+requirement they satisfy. Rationale: traceability keeps execution aligned with\n+the spec and simplifies review.\n+\n+### V. Simplicity with Explicit Exceptions\n+Favor the smallest viable design; avoid adding new components or abstractions\n+unless the need is documented. Any complexity exception MUST be justified in the\n+plan's Complexity Tracking section. Rationale: simplicity preserves velocity and\n+maintainability.\n+\n+## Operational Standards\n+\n+- Specifications, plans, and task lists MUST use the templates in\n+  `.specify/templates/`.\n+- Requirements and acceptance scenarios MUST use declarative language\n+  (MUST/SHALL) and avoid vague terms.\n+- Compliance with these standards MUST be verified during reviews.\n+\n+## Development Workflow\n+\n+- Create `spec.md` first, then `plan.md`, then `tasks.md`, in that order.\n+- Run the Constitution Check gate in the plan before Phase 0 research and\n+  re-check after design updates.\n+- If tests are requested, list test tasks before implementation tasks.\n+\n+## Governance\n+\n+- The constitution supersedes other guidance when conflicts exist.\n+- Amendments require a documented rationale, an impact summary, and a version\n+  bump in this file.\n+- Versioning follows semantic rules: MAJOR for incompatible governance changes,\n+  MINOR for new principles/sections, PATCH for clarifications.\n+- Reviews MUST confirm constitution compliance and document any deviations with\n+  rationale and remediation plans.\n+\n+**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): original adoption date not found | **Last Amended**: 2025-12-25\n*** End Patch"}}

APIs or patterns MUST NOT be guessed. Rationale: verified docs prevent\\n+compatibility errors.\\n+\\n+### III. Standard Project Initialization\\n+Projects MUST be created with `create-next-app@latest`, use App Router, and\\n+initialize Tailwind via the official Next.js integration. shadcn/ui MUST be\\n+initialized with `npx shadcn@latest init`. Rationale: standardized bootstrap\\n+reduces configuration drift.\\n+\\n+### IV. Editorial UI Quality\\n+Interfaces MUST feel modern, premium, and editorial, with a clear typography\\n+hierarchy (hero \\u001a section titles \\u001a body), generous whitespace, restrained\\n+color usage, and subtle purposeful motion. Rationale: consistent design quality\\n+is part of the product definition.\\n+\\n+### V. shadcn-First Components\\n+shadcn/ui primitives MUST be used for Button, Card, Badge, Tabs, Accordion,\\n+Dialog, Input, Select, Separator, Skeleton, and toast. Custom components MUST\\n+compose these primitives and follow the structure: `components/ui`,\\n+`components/sections`, `components/domain`. Rationale: composition preserves\\n+accessibility and design consistency.\\n+\\n+### VI.

Rationale:\\n+local-first data keeps the project self-contained and reliable.\\n+\\n+### VII. Run-Ready, Accessible, Maintainable\\n+The project MUST run via `npm install` and `npm run dev` with no missing configs,\\n+TODOs, or broken imports.

Approved Stack Only\nThe stack MUST be Next.js (latest stable) with App Router, TypeScript (strict),\nTailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. Deviations require a formal amendment. Rationale:\nconsistent tooling keeps velocity high and integration predictable.\n\n### II. Documentation via Context7\nMCP server context7 MUST be the source of truth for Next.js APIs and App Router\nconventions, Tailwind CSS setup and configuration, and shadcn/ui installation\nand usage. APIs or patterns MUST NOT be guessed. Rationale: verified docs prevent\ncompatibility errors.\n\n### III. Standard Project Initialization\nProjects MUST be created with `create-next-app@latest`, use App Router, and\ninitialize Tailwind via the official Next.js integration. shadcn/ui MUST be\ninitialized with `npx shadcn@latest init`. Rationale: standardized bootstrap\nreduces configuration drift.\n\n### IV. Editorial UI Quality\nInterfaces MUST feel modern, premium, and editorial, with a clear typography\nhierarchy (hero -> section titles -> body), generous whitespace, restrained\ncolor usage, and subtle purposeful motion. Rationale: consistent design quality\nis part of the product definition.\n\n### V. shadcn-First Components\nshadcn/ui primitives MUST be used for Button, Card, Badge, Tabs, Accordion,\nDialog, Input, Select, Separator, Skeleton, and toast. Custom components MUST\ncompose these primitives and follow the structure: `components/ui`,\n`components/sections`, `components/domain`. Rationale: composition preserves\naccessibility and design consistency.\n\n### VI. Local Data with Predictable State\nDestination data MUST use local seed data, and user reviews MUST persist via\nlocalStorage. Client-side state MUST remain predictable and clean. Rationale:\nlocal-first data keeps the project self-contained and reliable.\n\n### VII. Run-Ready, Accessible, Maintainable\nThe project MUST run via `npm install` and `npm run dev` with no missing configs,\nTODOs, or broken imports. Accessibility MUST be respected with semantic HTML and\nkeyboard navigation. Code MUST be readable, modular, and maintainable. Rationale:\nquality and DX are non-negotiable for delivery.\n\n## Implementation Requirements\n\n- Stack is fixed to Next.js (latest stable) with App Router, TypeScript (strict),\n  Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui.\n- Initialization MUST use `create-next-app@latest`, the official Next.js +\n  Tailwind integration, and `npx shadcn@latest init`.\n- UI primitives MUST come from shadcn/ui and be composed into higher-level\n  components; directory layout is `components/ui`, `components/sections`,\n  `components/domain`.\n- Destination data is local seed data; reviews persist in localStorage; no\n  external backend is required.\n- MCP context7 MUST be consulted for Next.js, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui usage.\n\n## Design & Quality Standards\n\n- Maintain the editorial visual style with strong typography hierarchy and\n  generous whitespace.\n- Color usage MUST remain restrained and harmonious.\n- Motion MUST be subtle and purposeful (hover, focus, light transitions).\n- Output MUST be immediately runnable with `npm install` and `npm run dev`.\n- Accessibility and code maintainability are mandatory.\n\n## Governance\n\n- The constitution supersedes other guidance when conflicts exist.\n- Amendments require documented rationale, a Sync Impact Report update, and a\n  version bump in this file.\n- Versioning follows semantic rules: MAJOR for incompatible governance changes,\n  MINOR for new principles or sections, PATCH for clarifications.\n- Reviews MUST confirm constitution compliance and document any deviations with\n  rationale and remediation plans.\n\n**Version**: 2.0.0 | **Ratified**: TODO(RATIFICATION_DATE): original adoption date not found | **Last Amended**: 2025-12-25\n"}}

Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4.

{"timestamp":"2025-12-25T10:49:59.023Z","type":"event_msg","payload":{"type":"user_message","message":"\n## User Input\n\n```text\n\n```\n\nYou **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).\n\n## Outline\n\nThe text the user typed after `/speckit.specify` in the triggering message **is** the feature description. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.\n\nGiven that feature description, do this:\n\n1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:\n   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords\n   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature\n   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., \"add-user-auth\", \"fix-payment-bug\")\n   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)\n   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance\n   - Examples:\n     - \"I want to add user authentication\" → \"user-auth\"\n     - \"Implement OAuth2 integration for the API\" → \"oauth2-api-integration\"\n     - \"Create a dashboard for analytics\" → \"analytics-dashboard\"\n     - \"Fix payment processing timeout bug\" → \"fix-payment-timeout\"\n\n2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:\n\n   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:\n\n      ```bash\n      git fetch --all --prune\n      ```\n\n   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:\n      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`\n      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`\n\n   c. Determine the next available number:\n      - Extract all numbers from all three sources\n      - Find the highest number N\n      - Use N+1 for the new branch number\n\n   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"\"` with the calculated number and short-name:\n      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name \"your-short-name\"` along with the feature description\n      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"\" --json --number 5 --short-name \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json \"\" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName \"user-auth\" \"Add user authentication\"`\n\n   **IMPORTANT**:\n   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number\n   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern\n   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1\n   - You must only ever run this script once per feature\n   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for\n   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths\n   - For single quotes in args like \"I'm Groot\", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: \"I'm Groot\")\n\n3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.\n\n4. Follow this execution flow:\n\n    1. Parse user description from Input\n       If empty: ERROR \"No feature description provided\"\n    2. Extract key concepts from description\n       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints\n    3. For unclear aspects:\n       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards\n       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:\n         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience\n         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications\n         - No reasonable default exists\n       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**\n       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details\n    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section\n       If no clear user flow: ERROR \"Cannot determine user scenarios\"\n    5. Generate Functional Requirements\n       Each requirement must be testable\n       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)\n    6. Define Success Criteria\n       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes\n       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)\n       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details\n    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)\n    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)\n\n5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.\n\n6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:\n\n   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:\n\n      ```markdown\n      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]\n      \n      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning\n      **Created**: [DATE]\n      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]\n      \n      ## Content Quality\n      \n      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)\n      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs\n      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders\n      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed\n      \n      ## Requirement Completeness\n      \n      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain\n      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous\n      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable\n      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)\n      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined\n      - [ ] Edge cases are identified\n      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded\n      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified\n      \n      ## Feature Readiness\n      \n      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria\n      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows\n      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria\n      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification\n      \n      ## Notes\n      \n      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`\n      ```\n\n   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:\n      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails\n      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)\n\n   c. **Handle Validation Results**:\n\n      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6\n\n      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:\n        1. List the failing items and specific issues\n        2. Update the spec to address each issue\n        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)\n        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user\n\n      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:\n        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec\n        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest\n        3.

Discover destinations quickly (Priority: P1)\n\nA visitor lands on the site and is inspired by editorial content, then finds\nrelevant destinations without friction.\n\n**Why this priority**: The homepage discovery flow is the primary value driver.\n\n**Independent Test**: A user can land on the homepage, view trending and top\nrated destinations, and initiate a search without navigating elsewhere.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the homepage loads, **When** the user scans the hero and curated\n   sections, **Then** they see clear destination highlights and can start a\n   search immediately.\n2. **Given** the homepage content is available, **When** the user selects a\n   destination card, **Then** they can proceed to a detailed view of that\n   destination.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Browse and filter destinations (Priority: P1)\n\nA visitor browses the destination catalog, searches by name or country, applies\nfilters, and sorts results to find what matches their interests.\n\n**Why this priority**: Search and filtering are core to exploration and reduce\nfrustration for users with specific preferences.\n\n**Independent Test**: A user can search by text, apply at least one filter and\nsort option, and see updated results or an empty state.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the destinations list is available, **When** the user searches for\n   a destination or country, **Then** the results update to match the query.\n2. **Given** filters and sorting controls are visible, **When** the user applies\n   a region filter and a tag filter, **Then** results reflect both constraints.\n3. **Given** no destinations match the selected filters, **When** the user\n   applies the filters, **Then** an empty state explains there are no results.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Explore a destination and reviews (Priority: P2)\n\nA visitor opens a destination page, reads highlights, explores tabs for\noverview, reviews, and travel guide content, and understands the destination\nat a glance.\n\n**Why this priority**: Detailed destination pages create trust and depth.\n\n**Independent Test**: A user can open a destination page, switch between tabs,\nread the FAQ, and see existing reviews.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a valid destination, **When** the user views the detail page,\n   **Then** they see a cover image, metadata, highlights, and tabbed content.\n2. **Given** the user selects the Reviews tab, **When** they open it, **Then**\n   review cards are visible and readable.\n3. **Given** the user selects the Travel Guide tab, **When** they open it,\n   **Then** curated guidance content is displayed.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 4 - Write and persist a review (Priority: P2)\n\nA visitor writes a review for a destination and sees it persist across reloads.\n\n**Why this priority**: Reviews add credibility and personalization.\n\n**Independent Test**: A user submits a review, reloads the page, and still sees\nthat review listed for the destination.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the user opens the review form, **When** they submit a valid review,\n   **Then** it appears in the review list for that destination.\n2. **Given** a review has been submitted, **When** the page is reloaded,\n   **Then** the review is still visible for the same destination.\n3. **Given** invalid review input, **When** the user submits the form,\n   **Then** clear validation feedback is shown and the review is not saved.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when a destination search returns zero matches?\n- How does the system handle invalid or unknown destination slugs?\n- What happens when there are no reviews yet for a destination?\n- How does the system handle a review rating outside the 1–5 range?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\nEach requirement MUST map to at least one user story and acceptance scenario.\n\n- **FR-001**: The homepage MUST present a hero area, trending destinations,\n  top-rated destinations, a travel guide teaser, and a newsletter call-to-action.\n- **FR-002**: The destinations list MUST support searching by destination name\n  or country.\n- **FR-003**: The destinations list MUST support filtering by region and tags.\n- **FR-004**: The destinations list MUST support sorting by top rated, most\n  reviewed, and newest.\n- **FR-005**: The destinations list MUST show a loading state and an empty state\n  when no results match filters.\n- **FR-006**: Each destination detail page MUST show a cover image, metadata,\n  highlights (best time to visit, budget level, must-do list), and tabs for\n  overview, reviews, and travel guide content.\n- **FR-007**: The reviews section MUST display review cards with rating, title,\n  body, author, and date.\n- **FR-008**: The review form MUST validate required fields and rating range\n  (1–5) before saving.\n- **FR-009**: Submitted reviews MUST persist across page reloads for the same\n  destination.\n- **FR-010**: An FAQ section MUST be available on destination pages.\n- **FR-011**: The about page MUST explain the platform concept and methodology.\n- **FR-012**: The experience MUST be responsive and readable on mobile and\n  desktop screens.\n- **FR-013**: The system MUST include at least 12 destinations across all major\n  regions (Asia, Europe, Americas, Africa, Oceania).\n- **FR-014**: Invalid destination URLs MUST present a clear not-found state.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Destination**: slug, name, country, region, description, tags, average\n  rating, review count, highlights (best time to visit, budget level, must-do\n  list), images.\n- **Review**: id, destination slug, author name, rating (1–5), title, body,\n  created date.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: 90% of users can find a destination of interest within 2 minutes\n  using search or filters in a usability test.\n- **SC-002**: 95% of users can submit a review successfully on the first attempt\n  without assistance.\n- **SC-003**: 100% of destination pages render key content (cover, metadata,\n  highlights, tabs) without blank states.\n- **SC-004**: At least 12 destinations are available and distributed across the\n  defined regions.\n- **SC-005**: 90% of users rate the visual design as \"polished\" or better in a\n  post-task survey.\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- No user accounts or authentication are required.\n- Reviews are stored locally within the browser for this experience.\n- All content is English-only for initial launch.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Destination content and imagery must be available at build time.\n"}}

Approved Stack Only\nThe stack MUST be Next.js (latest stable) with App Router, TypeScript (strict),\nTailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. Deviations require a formal amendment. Rationale:\nconsistent tooling keeps velocity high and integration predictable.\n\n### II. Documentation via Context7\nMCP server context7 MUST be the source of truth for Next.js APIs and App Router\nconventions, Tailwind CSS setup and configuration, and shadcn/ui installation\nand usage. APIs or patterns MUST NOT be guessed. Rationale: verified docs prevent\ncompatibility errors.\n\n### III. Standard Project Initialization\nProjects MUST be created with `create-next-app@latest`, use App Router, and\ninitialize Tailwind via the official Next.js integration. shadcn/ui MUST be\ninitialized with `npx shadcn@latest init`. Rationale: standardized bootstrap\nreduces configuration drift.\n\n### IV. Editorial UI Quality\nInterfaces MUST feel modern, premium, and editorial, with a clear typography\nhierarchy (hero -> section titles -> body), generous whitespace, restrained\ncolor usage, and subtle purposeful motion. Rationale: consistent design quality\nis part of the product definition.\n\n### V. shadcn-First Components\nshadcn/ui primitives MUST be used for Button, Card, Badge, Tabs, Accordion,\nDialog, Input, Select, Separator, Skeleton, and toast. Custom components MUST\ncompose these primitives and follow the structure: `components/ui`,\n`components/sections`, `components/domain`. Rationale: composition preserves\naccessibility and design consistency.\n\n### VI. Local Data with Predictable State\nDestination data MUST use local seed data, and user reviews MUST persist via\nlocalStorage. Client-side state MUST remain predictable and clean. Rationale:\nlocal-first data keeps the project self-contained and reliable.\n\n### VII. Run-Ready, Accessible, Maintainable\nThe project MUST run via `npm install` and `npm run dev` with no missing configs,\nTODOs, or broken imports. Accessibility MUST be respected with semantic HTML and\nkeyboard navigation. Code MUST be readable, modular, and maintainable. Rationale:\nquality and DX are non-negotiable for delivery.\n\n## Implementation Requirements\n\n- Stack is fixed to Next.js (latest stable) with App Router, TypeScript (strict),\n  Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui.\n- Initialization MUST use `create-next-app@latest`, the official Next.js +\n  Tailwind integration, and `npx shadcn@latest init`.\n- UI primitives MUST come from shadcn/ui and be composed into higher-level\n  components; directory layout is `components/ui`, `components/sections`,\n  `components/domain`.\n- Destination data is local seed data; reviews persist in localStorage; no\n  external backend is required.\n- MCP context7 MUST be consulted for Next.js, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui usage.\n\n## Design & Quality Standards\n\n- Maintain the editorial visual style with strong typography hierarchy and\n  generous whitespace.\n- Color usage MUST remain restrained and harmonious.\n- Motion MUST be subtle and purposeful (hover, focus, light transitions).\n- Output MUST be immediately runnable with `npm install` and `npm run dev`.\n- Accessibility and code maintainability are mandatory.\n\n## Governance\n\n- The constitution supersedes other guidance when conflicts exist.\n- Amendments require documented rationale, a Sync Impact Report update, and a\n  version bump in this file.\n- Versioning follows semantic rules: MAJOR for incompatible governance changes,\n  MINOR for new principles or sections, PATCH for clarifications.\n- Reviews MUST confirm constitution compliance and document any deviations with\n  rationale and remediation plans.\n\n**Version**: 2.0.0 | **Ratified**: Ratified on: 2025-12-25 | **Last Amended**: 2025-12-25\n"}}

It uses `fetch()` with `cache: 'force-cache'`, `cache: 'no-store'`, and `next: { revalidate: N }` options to mimic `getStaticProps`, `getServerSideProps`, and `getStaticProps` with `revalidate` respectively.\\n\\n```tsx\\nexport default async function Page() {\\n  // This request should be cached until manually invalidated.\\n  // Similar to `getStaticProps`.\\n  // `force-cache` is the default and can be omitted.\\n  const staticData = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'force-cache' })\\n\\n  // This request should be refetched on every request.\\n  // Similar to `getServerSideProps`.\\n  const dynamicData = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'no-store' })\\n\\n  // This request should be cached with a lifetime of 10 seconds.\\n  // Similar to `getStaticProps` with the `revalidate` option.\\n  const revalidatedData = await fetch(`https://...`, {\\n    next: { revalidate: 10 },\\n  })\\n\\n  return <div>...</div>\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```jsx\\nexport default async function Page() {\\n  // This request should be cached until manually invalidated.\\n  // Similar to `getStaticProps`.\\n  // `force-cache` is the default and can be omitted.\\n  const staticData = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'force-cache' })\\n\\n  // This request should be refetched on every request.\\n  // Similar to `getServerSideProps`.\\n  const dynamicData = await fetch(`https://...`, { cache: 'no-store' })\\n\\n  // This request should be cached with a lifetime of 10 seconds.\\n  // Similar to `getStaticProps` with the `revalidate` option.\\n  const revalidatedData = await fetch(`https://...`, {\\n    next: { revalidate: 10 },\\n  })\\n\\n  return <div>...</div>\\n}\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n### App Router - Basic Page Structure with Layout in TypeScript\\n\\nSource: https://context7.com/vercel/next.js/llms.txt\\n\\nDemonstrates the fundamental App Router structure using file-system based routing where folders define routes and special files (page.tsx, layout.tsx) define UI components. The RootLayout component wraps all pages with HTML boilerplate and common layout elements. This is the foundation for building pages in Next.js 16 using the modern App Router approach.\\n\\n```typescript\\n// app/page.tsx\\nexport default function Page() {\\n  return <h1>Hello, Next.js!</h1>;\\n}\\n\\n// app/layout.tsx\\nexport default function RootLayout({\\n  children,\\n}: {\\n  children: React.ReactNode;\\n}) {\\n  return (\\n    <html lang=\\\"en\\\">\\n      <body>{children}</body>\\n    </html>\\n  );\\n}\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n### Disable Next.js App Router Programmatic Scroll with useRouter\\n\\nSource: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-app/03-api-reference/02-components/link.mdx\\n\\nWhen performing programmatic navigation in the Next.js App Router using `router.push()` or `router.replace()`, scrolling to the top can be disabled by passing an options object with `scroll: false`. This prevents the default scroll behavior after the navigation occurs.\\n\\n```jsx\\n// useRouter\\nimport { useRouter } from 'next/navigation'\\n\\nconst router = useRouter()\\n\\nrouter.push('/dashboard', { scroll: false })\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n### Static Data Fetching with Automatic Caching in App Directory\\n\\nSource: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-app/02-guides/migrating/app-router-migration.mdx\\n\\nFetch and cache data in the app directory using the fetch() API with default cache behavior (cache: 'force-cache'). This approach replaces getStaticProps functionality by automatically caching fetched data until manual invalidation, providing static site generation benefits.\\n\\n```jsx\\n// `app` directory\\n\\n// This function can be named anything\\nasync function getProjects() {\\n  const res = await fetch(`https://...`)\\n  const projects = await res.json()\\n\\n  return projects\\n}\\n\\nexport default async function Index() {\\n  const projects = await getProjects()\\n\\n  return projects.map((project) => <div>{project.name}</div>)\\n}\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n### Configure Next.js Incremental Static Regeneration in `app` directory with `fetch`\\n\\nSource: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-app/02-guides/migrating/app-router-migration.mdx\\n\\nThis example shows how to achieve Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) within the Next.js `app` directory using the native `fetch()` API. The `revalidate` option within the `next` property of the fetch options caches the request for a specified duration, triggering regeneration upon subsequent access after the cache expires.\\n\\n```jsx\\n// `app` directory\\n\\nasync function getPosts() {\\n  const res = await fetch(`https://.../posts`, { next: { revalidate: 60 } })\\n  const data = await res.json()\\n\\n  return data.posts\\n}\\n\\nexport default async function PostList() {\\n  const posts = await getPosts()\\n\\n  return posts.map((post) => <div>{post.name}</div>)\\n}\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n### Import and Use Routing Hooks from next/navigation\\n\\nSource: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-app/02-guides/migrating/app-router-migration.mdx\\n\\nDemonstrates how to import and use the three new routing hooks (useRouter, usePathname, useSearchParams) in a Client Component within the app directory. These hooks must be used with the 'use client' directive and are not available in Server Components.\\n\\n```tsx\\n'use client'\\n\\nimport { useRouter, usePathname, useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\\n\\nexport default function ExampleClientComponent() {\\n  const router = useRouter()\\n  const pathname = usePathname()\\n  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\\n\\n  // ...\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```jsx\\n'use client'\\n\\nimport { useRouter, usePathname, useSearchParams } from 'next/navigation'\\n\\nexport default function ExampleClientComponent() {\\n  const router = useRouter()\\n  const pathname = usePathname()\\n  const searchParams = useSearchParams()\\n\\n  // ...\\n}\\n```\",\"type\":\"text\"}]"}}

The `src` property accepts a URL string, and `width` and `height` props are explicitly set to ensure correct aspect ratio and prevent layout shift, as Next.js cannot determine these for remote images during build time.\\n\\n```tsx\\nimport Image from 'next/image'\\n\\nexport default function Page() {\\n  return (\\n    <Image\\n      src=\\\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket/profile.png\\\"\\n      alt=\\\"Picture of the author\\\"\\n      width={500}\\n      height={500}\\n    />\\n  )\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport Image from 'next/image'\\n\\nexport default function Page() {\\n  return (\\n    <Image\\n      src=\\\"https://s3.amazonaws.com/my-bucket/profile.png\\\"\\n      alt=\\\"Picture of the author\\\"\\n      width={500}\\n      height={500}\\n    />\\n  )\\n}\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n### Specify Image Sizes for Responsive Next.js Images\\n\\nSource: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-app/03-api-reference/02-components/image.mdx\\n\\nThis snippet illustrates how to use the `sizes` property with the Next.js `Image` component, especially when the `fill` prop is active or CSS makes the image responsive. The `sizes` property helps the browser choose the most appropriate image from the generated `srcset` at different breakpoints. This prevents unnecessarily large images from being downloaded and optimizes responsive layouts.\\n\\n```jsx\\nimport Image from 'next/image'\\n\\nexport default function Page() {\\n  return (\\n    <div className=\\\"grid-element\\\">\\n      <Image\\n        fill\\n        src=\\\"/example.png\\\"\\n        sizes=\\\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, (max-width: 1200px) 50vw, 33vw\\\"\\n      />\\n    </div>\\n  )\\n}\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n### Use Data URL for Blurred Placeholder in Next.js `Image` Component\\n\\nSource: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-app/03-api-reference/02-components/image.mdx\\n\\nThe `blurDataURL` prop specifies a Data URL to be used as a placeholder image before the main image successfully loads, typically in conjunction with `placeholder=\\\"blur\\\"`. For static `jpg`, `png`, `webp`, or `avif` files, `blurDataURL` can be automatically generated by Next.js (unless the image is animated). For dynamic or remote images, it must be provided manually, ideally as a small, simple image (e.g., 10px or less) to avoid performance degradation.\\n\\n```jsx\\n<Image placeholder=\\\"blur\\\" blurDataURL=\\\"...\\\" />\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n### Statically import local images with automatic optimization in Next.js\\n\\nSource: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-app/01-getting-started/12-images.mdx\\n\\nImport image files directly as modules for automatic width, height, and blur data URL generation by Next.js. This approach eliminates manual dimension specification and enables optional blur-up placeholder effects during image loading. Width and height are automatically inferred from the imported image.\\n\\n```typescript\\nimport Image from 'next/image'\\nimport ProfileImage from './profile.png'\\n\\nexport default function Page() {\\n  return (\\n    <Image\\n      src={ProfileImage}\\n      alt=\\\"Picture of the author\\\"\\n      // width={500} automatically provided\\n      // height={500} automatically provided\\n      // blurDataURL=\\\"data:...\\\" automatically provided\\n      // placeholder=\\\"blur\\\" // Optional blur-up while loading\\n    />\\n  )\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```javascript\\nimport Image from 'next/image'\\nimport ProfileImage from './profile.png'\\n\\nexport default function Page() {\\n  return (\\n    <Image\\n      src={ProfileImage}\\n      alt=\\\"Picture of the author\\\"\\n      // width={500} automatically provided\\n      // height={500} automatically provided\\n      // blurDataURL=\\\"data:...\\\" automatically provided\\n      // placeholder=\\\"blur\\\" // Optional blur-up while loading\\n    />\\n  )\\n}\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n### Configure imageSizes in Next.js\\n\\nSource: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-app/03-api-reference/02-components/image.mdx\\n\\nSet a list of image widths for responsive images that provide a sizes prop. These widths are combined with deviceSizes to generate the srcset. Used only for images smaller than full screen width.\\n\\n```javascript\\nmodule.exports = {\\n  images: {\\n    imageSizes: [32, 48, 64, 96, 128, 256, 384],\\n  },\\n}\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n### Control Image Loading Behavior with Next.js `Image` Component\\n\\nSource: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-app/03-api-reference/02-components/image.mdx\\n\\nThe `loading` prop controls when an image begins to load. Setting it to `lazy` defers loading until the image is within a calculated distance from the viewport, improving initial page load performance. Setting it to `eager` causes the image to load immediately, regardless of its position, which should only be used for images that are critical for the initial view.\\n\\n```jsx\\n// Defaults to lazy\\n<Image loading=\\\"lazy\\\" />\\n```\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n### Import Static Images from External URLs in Next.js\\n\\nSource: https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/docs/01-app/03-api-reference/05-config/01-next-config-js/urlImports.mdx\\n\\nThis Next.js example illustrates importing a static image directly from an external URL, similar to a local file import. The imported image is then used with the `next/image` component, benefiting from Next.js's image optimization features.\\n\\n```js\\nimport Image from 'next/image'\\nimport logo from 'https://example.com/assets/logo.png'\\n\\nexport default () => (\\n  <div>\\n    <Image src={logo} placeholder=\\\"blur\\\" />\\n  </div>\\n)\\n```\",\"type\":\"text\"}]"}}

I'm always surprised at how complicated seemingly simple things end up being with a lot of these tools, but I'm very bullish on the future of Next.js and looking forward to building the next iteration of [tailwindcss.com](https://tailwindcss.com) with it in the months to come.\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nSource: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com/blob/main/src/blog/building-the-tailwind-blog/index.mdx\\n\\nChoosing a platform: There are a lot of things to like about Next.js, but the primary reason we decided to use it is that it has great support for [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/), which is the format we wanted to use to author our posts.\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nSource: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com/blob/main/src/blog/building-the-tailwind-blog/index.mdx\\n\\nDisplaying post previews: Essentially what we wanted to be able to do was use the `getStaticProps` feature of Next.js to get a list of all the posts at build-time, extract the information we need, and pass that in to the actual page component to render.\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n### Next.js Configuration > Webpack Customization\\n\\nSource: https://context7.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com/llms.txt\\n\\nCustom webpack configuration in Next.js enables advanced handling of static assets and build optimization. SVG files with the `.react.svg` extension can be imported as React components by excluding them from standard SVG rules and applying the `@svgr/webpack` loader instead. CSS minification can be disabled by filtering out the CssMinimizerPlugin from the optimization minimizers, which is useful when working with Tailwind CSS to preserve specific styling behaviors during development and production builds.\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nSource: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com/blob/main/src/blog/building-the-tailwind-blog/index.mdx\\n\\nChoosing a platform: We're a team of developers so naturally there was no way we could convince ourselves to use something off-the-shelf, and opted to build something simple and custom with [Next.js](http://nextjs.org).\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n### Next.js Configuration > Core Setup\\n\\nSource: https://context7.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com/llms.txt\\n\\nNext.js configuration with Tailwind CSS v4 involves several key setup steps. The `serverExternalPackages` property specifies packages that should be rendered server-side, such as `@tailwindcss/node`. To support MDX files as pages, add them to the `pageExtensions` array alongside standard JavaScript and TypeScript extensions. The `outputFileTracingIncludes` option ensures MDX documentation files are properly included in the build output by specifying glob patterns for inclusion.\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n### Next.js Configuration > URL Management\\n\\nSource: https://context7.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com/llms.txt\\n\\nURL management in Next.js documentation sites involves configuring redirects and rewrites. The `redirects` function handles deprecated or moved documentation pages, mapping old URLs to new ones with permanent or temporary redirect status. The `rewrites` function proxies requests to external services like Tailwind UI, allowing seamless integration of remote content under the same domain without exposing the actual backend URLs to users.\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n### Next.js Configuration > Experimental Features\\n\\nSource: https://context7.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com/llms.txt\\n\\nNext.js experimental features enable performance optimizations and modern tooling for Tailwind CSS projects. The `mdxRs` flag activates a fast Rust-based MDX compiler for improved build performance. The Turbo configuration allows custom webpack rules to be applied in development builds, such as importing SVG files as React components using the `@svgr/webpack` loader with appropriate file naming conventions like `.react.svg`.\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nSource: https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com/blob/main/src/blog/2022-05-23-headless-ui-v1-6-tailwind-ui-team-management/index.mdx\\n\\nTailwind CSS templates are coming soon: Here's a sneak peek at one of them — a documentation site template built with <Link href=\\\"https://nextjs.org/\\\">Next.js</Link> and Stripe's new <Link href=\\\"https://markdoc.io/\\\">Markdoc</Link> library:\\n\\n--------------------------------\\n\\n### Project Overview > Architecture\\n\\nSource: https://context7.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss.com/llms.txt\\n\\nThe project employs a modern Next.js architecture with parallel routes, nested layouts, and TypeScript throughout. Documentation is organized hierarchically with sections covering core concepts, utility classes, and framework-specific integration guides. The site supports both light and dark modes, includes interactive resizable examples with Framer Motion, and provides extensive API reference tables for all Tailwind utilities.\",\"type\":\"text\"}]"}}

See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.\\n\\n## Summary\\n\\nBuild a polished, editorial travel discovery and review experience with four\\nprimary routes (home, destinations index, destination detail, about), curated\\nlocal seed data, and client-side review persistence. The plan prioritizes\\nApp Router conventions, shadcn/ui primitives, and a responsive layout with\\nloading/empty/not-found states.\\n\\n## Technical Context\\n\\n**Language/Version**: TypeScript (strict)  \\n**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js (latest stable, App Router), Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui  \\n**Storage**: local seed data + localStorage for reviews  \\n**Testing**: Manual QA (no automated tests requested)  \\n**Target Platform**: Modern evergreen browsers (desktop + mobile)  \\n**Project Type**: Web app (frontend-only)  \\n**Performance Goals**: Initial content visible within 2s on broadband; smooth\\ninteractions for filtering and tabs  \\n**Constraints**: No backend, no external APIs, run-ready with `npm install` and\\n`npm run dev`  \\n**Scale/Scope**: 4 routes, 12+ destinations, local reviews persisted per\\ndestination\\n\\n## Constitution Check\\n\\n*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*\\n\\n- Stack matches Next.js (latest stable, App Router), TypeScript (strict),\\n  Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui\\n- MCP context7 is the source of truth for Next.js, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui\\n- App Router is used; Pages Router is not used\\n- shadcn/ui primitives are used for applicable UI elements and composed into\\n  sections/domain components\\n- Component layout follows `components/ui`, `components/sections`,\\n  `components/domain`\\n- Destination data uses local seed data; reviews persist via localStorage\\n- Spec exists and uses the spec template with prioritized, independently\\n  testable user stories\\n- Requirements are testable and traceable to at least one user story\\n- If tests are requested, test tasks are listed before implementation tasks\\n- Tasks reference explicit file paths and story/requirement identifiers\\n- Any complexity exceptions are justified in the Complexity Tracking section\\n\\n**Gate status**: PASS\\n\\n## Project Structure\\n\\n### Documentation (this feature)\\n\\n```text\\nspecs/001-travel-discovery-reviews/\\n├── plan.md\\n├── research.md\\n├── data-model.md\\n├── quickstart.md\\n├── contracts/\\n│   └── destinations-api.yaml\\n└── tasks.md\\n```\\n\\n### Source Code (repository root)\\n\\n```text\\napp/\\n├── layout.tsx\\n├── page.tsx\\n├── about/\\n│   └── page.tsx\\n├── destinations/\\n│   ├── page.tsx\\n│   └── [slug]/\\n│       ├── page.tsx\\n│       └── loading.tsx\\n└── not-found.tsx\\n\\ncomponents/\\n├── ui/              # shadcn/ui primitives\\n├── sections/        # page sections (hero, grids, CTAs)\\n└── domain/          # destination and review components\\n\\ndata/\\n└── destinations.ts\\n\\nlib/\\n├── filters.ts\\n├── reviews.ts\\n└── metadata.ts\\n\\npublic/\\n└── images/\\n```\\n\\n**Structure Decision**: Single Next.js app using the App Router with feature\\nsections and domain components separated from shadcn primitives.\\n\\n## Phase 0: Research\\n\\n**Outputs**: /Users/channachot/Desktop/WORK/test-spec-kit/specs/001-travel-discovery-reviews/research.md\\n\\nKey decisions resolved:\\n- App Router structure with `app/layout.tsx` and `page.tsx` routing\\n- Metadata via `metadata` exports / `generateMetadata`\\n- Image handling with `next/image` and explicit dimensions\\n- Tailwind initialization via official Next.js integration\\n- shadcn/ui initialization via `npx shadcn@latest init`\\n- Review persistence via localStorage\\n\\n## Phase 1: Design & Contracts\\n\\n**Outputs**:\\n- /Users/channachot/Desktop/WORK/test-spec-kit/specs/001-travel-discovery-reviews/data-model.md\\n- /Users/channachot/Desktop/WORK/test-spec-kit/specs/001-travel-discovery-reviews/contracts/destinations-api.yaml\\n- /Users/channachot/Desktop/WORK/test-spec-kit/specs/001-travel-discovery-reviews/quickstart.md\\n\\n**Data Model**: Destination and Review entities with validation rules and\\nreview-to-destination relationships.\\n\\n**Contracts**: Mock client-side data API that documents filtering, sorting, and\\nreview creation as if calling a local service layer.\\n\\n**Quickstart**: Standard Next.js + Tailwind initialization and shadcn/ui setup\\ncommands plus local run instructions.\\n\\n## Constitution Check (Post-Design)\\n\\n- Stack and routing align with App Router requirements\\n- shadcn/ui components and directory structure remain enforced\\n- Local data and localStorage persistence preserved\\n- Metadata and image usage aligned with documented Next.js APIs\\n\\n**Gate status**: PASS\\n\\n## Phase 2: Planning\\n\\nStop here.

Re-check after Phase 1 design.*\\n\\n- Stack matches Next.js (latest stable, App Router), TypeScript (strict),\\n  Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui\\n- MCP context7 is the source of truth for Next.js, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui\\n- App Router is used; Pages Router is not used\\n- shadcn/ui primitives are used for applicable UI elements and composed into\\n  sections/domain components\\n- Component layout follows `components/ui`, `components/sections`,\\n  `components/domain`\\n- Destination data uses local seed data; reviews persist via localStorage\\n- Spec exists and uses the spec template with prioritized, independently\\n  testable user stories\\n- Requirements are testable and traceable to at least one user story\\n- If tests are requested, test tasks are listed before implementation tasks\\n- Tasks reference explicit file paths and story/requirement identifiers\\n- Any complexity exceptions are justified in the Complexity Tracking section\\n\\n**Gate status**: PASS\\n\\n## Project Structure\\n\\n### Documentation (this feature)\\n\\n```text\\nspecs/001-travel-discovery-reviews/\\n├── plan.md\\n├── research.md\\n├── data-model.md\\n├── quickstart.md\\n├── contracts/\\n│   └── destinations-api.yaml\\n└── tasks.md\\n```\\n\\n### Source Code (repository root)\\n\\n```text\\napp/\\n├── layout.tsx\\n├── page.tsx\\n├── loading.tsx\\n├── not-found.tsx\\n├── about/\\n│   └── page.tsx\\n├── destinations/\\n│   ├── page.tsx\\n│   ├── loading.tsx\\n│   └── [slug]/\\n│       ├── page.tsx\\n│       ├── loading.tsx\\n│       └── not-found.tsx\\n\\ncomponents/\\n├── ui/              # shadcn/ui primitives\\n├── sections/        # home + index sections\\n└── domain/          # destination + review components\\n\\ndata/\\n└── destinations.ts\\n\\nlib/\\n├── filters.ts\\n├── reviews.ts\\n├── storage.ts\\n└── format.ts\\n\\npublic/\\n└── images/\\n```\\n\\n**Structure Decision**: Single Next.js App Router project with shared sections\\nand domain components. Loading and not-found files exist at root and for dynamic\\nroute segments where needed.\\n\\n## Implementation Steps\\n\\n### 1) Project initialization (context7-backed)\\n\\n- Create the project with `npx create-next-app@latest` (Next.js docs) and\\n  select:\\n  - TypeScript: Yes\\n  - App Router: Yes\\n  - Tailwind CSS: Yes\\n  - ESLint: Yes\\n- Initialize shadcn/ui with `npx shadcn@latest init` (shadcn/ui CLI docs).\\n- Add required shadcn/ui components using the CLI:\\n  - `npx shadcn@latest add button card badge tabs accordion dialog input select separator skeleton toast`\\n\\n### 2) Data and state flow design\\n\\n- Seed destinations from `data/destinations.ts` and expose helpers in\\n  `lib/filters.ts` for search, filter, and sort.\\n- Apply filters/sort client-side in the destinations index and in any shared\\n  discovery sections.\\n- Store reviews in localStorage keyed by `destinationSlug` using\\n  `lib/storage.ts` and `lib/reviews.ts` helpers.\\n- Derive ratingAverage and reviewCount by combining seed rating with user\\n  reviews. Plan:\\n  - Seed ratingAverage/reviewCount represent baseline editorial rating.\\n  - On render, merge baseline + user reviews to compute displayed values.\\n  - Destination detail reads merged values for metadata, badges, and cards.\\n\\n### 3) Route-level implementation\\n\\n- `/` (Home): hero + search, trending grid, top-rated row, travel guide teaser,\\n  newsletter CTA. Use `components/sections/*` for modular layout.\\n- `/destinations`: search input, region/tag filters, sort control, results grid\\n  using shadcn Card, Skeletons on load, empty state when no results.\\n- `/destinations/[slug]`: cover image (local placeholder), metadata, highlights,\\n  Tabs for Overview/Reviews/Travel Guide, review list, review dialog form with\\n  validation, FAQ accordion, not-found for invalid slug.\\n- `/about`: editorial mission and methodology.\\n\\n### 4) UI composition and primitives\\n\\n- Use shadcn/ui for Button, Card, Badge, Tabs, Accordion, Dialog, Input, Select,\\n  Separator, Skeleton, and toast across all applicable UI.\\n- Compose primitives into `components/domain` for DestinationCard, ReviewCard,\\n  ReviewFormDialog, and filter controls.\\n\\n### 5) Metadata and images (context7-backed)\\n\\n- Define static metadata for static routes via `export const metadata`.\\n- Use `generateMetadata` for destination detail pages based on slug.\\n- Use `next/image` with explicit `width`/`height` for local or remote images.\\n\\n### 6) Quality gates and checks\\n\\n- Accessibility: labels for inputs, keyboard navigation for Tabs/Dialog, focus\\n  trapping in dialog, and semantic headings.\\n- States: loading for `/`, `/destinations`, `/destinations/[slug]`; empty states\\n  for filters; not-found for invalid slugs.\\n- Responsive: verify hero, grids, tabs, review form, and CTA sections across\\n  mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints.\\n\\n## Definition of Done\\n\\n- [ ] `npm install` and `npm run dev` succeed with no missing configs\\n- [ ] All routes render correctly: `/`, `/destinations`, `/destinations/[slug]`, `/about`\\n- [ ] Filters and sorting work client-side on destinations index\\n- [ ] Reviews can be submitted and persist across reloads (localStorage)\\n- [ ] Loading, empty, and not-found states are present and functional\\n- [ ] UI is polished, cohesive, and editorial (non-generic)\\n- [ ] No broken links or runtime errors\\n- [ ] Accessibility checks pass (labels, keyboard nav, dialog focus)\\n\\n## Complexity Tracking\\n\\n> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**\\n\\n| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |\\n|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|\\nEOF\",\"workdir\":\"/Users/channachot/Desktop/WORK/test-spec-kit\",\"login\":false}","call_id":"call_9WH6Uf65umaR84qx0QObGi0C"}}

See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.\n\n## Summary\n\nDeliver a production-ready, editorial travel discovery experience with four\ncore routes (home, destinations index, destination detail, about), curated local\nseed data, client-side filtering/sorting, and localStorage-backed reviews. The\nimplementation follows App Router conventions, uses shadcn/ui primitives for\nall UI foundations, and includes loading, empty, and not-found states with\nresponsive layout and accessibility checks.\n\n## Technical Context\n\n**Language/Version**: TypeScript (strict)  \n**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js (latest stable, App Router), Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui  \n**Storage**: Local seed data module + localStorage (reviews)  \n**Testing**: Manual QA (no automated tests requested)  \n**Target Platform**: Modern evergreen browsers (desktop + mobile)  \n**Project Type**: Web app (frontend-only)  \n**Performance Goals**: Primary content visible within 2s on broadband; smooth\nfiltering and tab transitions  \n**Constraints**: No backend, no external APIs, run-ready with `npm install` and\n`npm run dev`  \n**Scale/Scope**: 4 routes, 12+ destinations, local reviews persisted per\nDestination\n\n## Constitution Check\n\n*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*\n\n- Stack matches Next.js (latest stable, App Router), TypeScript (strict),\n  Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui\n- MCP context7 is the source of truth for Next.js, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui\n- App Router is used; Pages Router is not used\n- shadcn/ui primitives are used for applicable UI elements and composed into\n  sections/domain components\n- Component layout follows `components/ui`, `components/sections`,\n  `components/domain`\n- Destination data uses local seed data; reviews persist via localStorage\n- Spec exists and uses the spec template with prioritized, independently\n  testable user stories\n- Requirements are testable and traceable to at least one user story\n- If tests are requested, test tasks are listed before implementation tasks\n- Tasks reference explicit file paths and story/requirement identifiers\n- Any complexity exceptions are justified in the Complexity Tracking section\n\n**Gate status**: PASS\n\n## Project Structure\n\n### Documentation (this feature)\n\n```text\nspecs/001-travel-discovery-reviews/\n├── plan.md\n├── research.md\n├── data-model.md\n├── quickstart.md\n├── contracts/\n│   └── destinations-api.yaml\n└── tasks.md\n```\n\n### Source Code (repository root)\n\n```text\napp/\n├── layout.tsx\n├── page.tsx\n├── loading.tsx\n├── not-found.tsx\n├── about/\n│   └── page.tsx\n├── destinations/\n│   ├── page.tsx\n│   ├── loading.tsx\n│   └── [slug]/\n│       ├── page.tsx\n│       ├── loading.tsx\n│       └── not-found.tsx\n\ncomponents/\n├── ui/              # shadcn/ui primitives\n├── sections/        # home + index sections\n└── domain/          # destination + review components\n\ndata/\n└── destinations.ts\n\nlib/\n├── filters.ts\n├── reviews.ts\n├── storage.ts\n└── format.ts\n\npublic/\n└── images/\n```\n\n**Structure Decision**: Single Next.js App Router project with shared sections\nand domain components. Loading and not-found files exist at root and for dynamic\nroute segments where needed.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n### 1) Project initialization (context7-backed)\n\n- Create the project with `npx create-next-app@latest` (Next.js docs) and\n  select:\n  - TypeScript: Yes\n  - App Router: Yes\n  - Tailwind CSS: Yes\n  - ESLint: Yes\n- Initialize shadcn/ui with `npx shadcn@latest init` (shadcn/ui CLI docs).\n- Add required shadcn/ui components using the CLI:\n  - `npx shadcn@latest add button card badge tabs accordion dialog input select separator skeleton toast`\n\n### 2) Data and state flow design\n\n- Seed destinations from `data/destinations.ts` and expose helpers in\n  `lib/filters.ts` for search, filter, and sort.\n- Apply filters/sort client-side in the destinations index and in any shared\n  discovery sections.\n- Store reviews in localStorage keyed by `destinationSlug` using\n  `lib/storage.ts` and `lib/reviews.ts` helpers.\n- Derive ratingAverage and reviewCount by combining seed rating with user\n  reviews. Plan:\n  - Seed ratingAverage/reviewCount represent baseline editorial rating.\n  - On render, merge baseline + user reviews to compute displayed values.\n  - Destination detail reads merged values for metadata, badges, and cards.\n\n### 3) Route-level implementation\n\n- `/` (Home): hero + search, trending grid, top-rated row, travel guide teaser,\n  newsletter CTA. Use `components/sections/*` for modular layout.\n- `/destinations`: search input, region/tag filters, sort control, results grid\n  using shadcn Card, Skeletons on load, empty state when no results.\n- `/destinations/[slug]`: cover image (local placeholder), metadata, highlights,\n  Tabs for Overview/Reviews/Travel Guide, review list, review dialog form with\n  validation, FAQ accordion, not-found for invalid slug.\n- `/about`: editorial mission and methodology.\n\n### 4) UI composition and primitives\n\n- Use shadcn/ui for Button, Card, Badge, Tabs, Accordion, Dialog, Input, Select,\n  Separator, Skeleton, and toast across all applicable UI.\n- Compose primitives into `components/domain` for DestinationCard, ReviewCard,\n  ReviewFormDialog, and filter controls.\n\n### 5) Metadata and images (context7-backed)\n\n- Define static metadata for static routes via `export const metadata`.\n- Use `generateMetadata` for destination detail pages based on slug.\n- Use `next/image` with explicit `width`/`height` for local or remote images.\n\n### 6) Quality gates and checks\n\n- Accessibility: labels for inputs, keyboard navigation for Tabs/Dialog, focus\n  trapping in dialog, and semantic headings.\n- States: loading for `/`, `/destinations`, `/destinations/[slug]`; empty states\n  for filters; not-found for invalid slugs.\n- Responsive: verify hero, grids, tabs, review form, and CTA sections across\n  mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints.\n\n## Definition of Done\n\n- [ ] `npm install` and `npm run dev` succeed with no missing configs\n- [ ] All routes render correctly: `/`, `/destinations`, `/destinations/[slug]`, `/about`\n- [ ] Filters and sorting work client-side on destinations index\n- [ ] Reviews can be submitted and persist across reloads (localStorage)\n- [ ] Loading, empty, and not-found states are present and functional\n- [ ] UI is polished, cohesive, and editorial (non-generic)\n- [ ] No broken links or runtime errors\n- [ ] Accessibility checks pass (labels, keyboard nav, dialog focus)\n\n## Complexity Tracking\n\n> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**\n\n| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |\n|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|\n"}}

Discover destinations quickly (Priority: P1)\n\nA visitor lands on the site and is inspired by editorial content, then finds\nrelevant destinations without friction.\n\n**Why this priority**: The homepage discovery flow is the primary value driver.\n\n**Independent Test**: A user can land on the homepage, view trending and top\nrated destinations, and initiate a search without navigating elsewhere.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the homepage loads, **When** the user scans the hero and curated\n   sections, **Then** they see clear destination highlights and can start a\n   search immediately.\n2. **Given** the homepage content is available, **When** the user selects a\n   destination card, **Then** they can proceed to a detailed view of that\n   destination.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 2 - Browse and filter destinations (Priority: P1)\n\nA visitor browses the destination catalog, searches by name or country, applies\nfilters, and sorts results to find what matches their interests.\n\n**Why this priority**: Search and filtering are core to exploration and reduce\nfrustration for users with specific preferences.\n\n**Independent Test**: A user can search by text, apply at least one filter and\nsort option, and see updated results or an empty state.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the destinations list is available, **When** the user searches for\n   a destination or country, **Then** the results update to match the query.\n2. **Given** filters and sorting controls are visible, **When** the user applies\n   a region filter and a tag filter, **Then** results reflect both constraints.\n3. **Given** no destinations match the selected filters, **When** the user\n   applies the filters, **Then** an empty state explains there are no results.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 3 - Explore a destination and reviews (Priority: P2)\n\nA visitor opens a destination page, reads highlights, explores tabs for\noverview, reviews, and travel guide content, and understands the destination\nat a glance.\n\n**Why this priority**: Detailed destination pages create trust and depth.\n\n**Independent Test**: A user can open a destination page, switch between tabs,\nread the FAQ, and see existing reviews.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** a valid destination, **When** the user views the detail page,\n   **Then** they see a cover image, metadata, highlights, and tabbed content.\n2. **Given** the user selects the Reviews tab, **When** they open it, **Then**\n   review cards are visible and readable.\n3. **Given** the user selects the Travel Guide tab, **When** they open it,\n   **Then** curated guidance content is displayed.\n\n---\n\n### User Story 4 - Write and persist a review (Priority: P2)\n\nA visitor writes a review for a destination and sees it persist across reloads.\n\n**Why this priority**: Reviews add credibility and personalization.\n\n**Independent Test**: A user submits a review, reloads the page, and still sees\nthat review listed for the destination.\n\n**Acceptance Scenarios**:\n\n1. **Given** the user opens the review form, **When** they submit a valid review,\n   **Then** it appears in the review list for that destination.\n2. **Given** a review has been submitted, **When** the page is reloaded,\n   **Then** the review is still visible for the same destination.\n3. **Given** invalid review input, **When** the user submits the form,\n   **Then** clear validation feedback is shown and the review is not saved.\n\n---\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n- What happens when a destination search returns zero matches?\n- How does the system handle invalid or unknown destination slugs?\n- What happens when there are no reviews yet for a destination?\n- How does the system handle a review rating outside the 1–5 range?\n\n## Requirements *(mandatory)*\n\n### Functional Requirements\n\nEach requirement MUST map to at least one user story and acceptance scenario.\n\n- **FR-001**: The homepage MUST present a hero area, trending destinations,\n  top-rated destinations, a travel guide teaser, and a newsletter call-to-action.\n- **FR-002**: The destinations list MUST support searching by destination name\n  or country.\n- **FR-003**: The destinations list MUST support filtering by region and tags.\n- **FR-004**: The destinations list MUST support sorting by top rated, most\n  reviewed, and newest.\n- **FR-005**: The destinations list MUST show a loading state and an empty state\n  when no results match filters.\n- **FR-006**: Each destination detail page MUST show a cover image, metadata,\n  highlights (best time to visit, budget level, must-do list), and tabs for\n  overview, reviews, and travel guide content.\n- **FR-007**: The reviews section MUST display review cards with rating, title,\n  body, author, and date.\n- **FR-008**: The review form MUST validate required fields and rating range\n  (1–5) before saving.\n- **FR-009**: Submitted reviews MUST persist across page reloads for the same\n  destination.\n- **FR-010**: An FAQ section MUST be available on destination pages.\n- **FR-011**: The about page MUST explain the platform concept and methodology.\n- **FR-012**: The experience MUST be responsive and readable on mobile and\n  desktop screens.\n- **FR-013**: The system MUST include at least 12 destinations across all major\n  regions (Asia, Europe, Americas, Africa, Oceania).\n- **FR-014**: Invalid destination URLs MUST present a clear not-found state.\n\n### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*\n\n- **Destination**: slug, name, country, region, description, tags, average\n  rating, review count, highlights (best time to visit, budget level, must-do\n  list), images.\n- **Review**: id, destination slug, author name, rating (1–5), title, body,\n  created date.\n\n## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*\n\n### Measurable Outcomes\n\n- **SC-001**: 90% of users can find a destination of interest within 2 minutes\n  using search or filters in a usability test.\n- **SC-002**: 95% of users can submit a review successfully on the first attempt\n  without assistance.\n- **SC-003**: 100% of destination pages render key content (cover, metadata,\n  highlights, tabs) without blank states.\n- **SC-004**: At least 12 destinations are available and distributed across the\n  defined regions.\n- **SC-005**: 90% of users rate the visual design as \"polished\" or better in a\n  post-task survey.\n\n## Assumptions\n\n- No user accounts or authentication are required.\n- Reviews are stored locally within the browser for this experience.\n- All content is English-only for initial launch.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n- Destination content and imagery must be available at build time.\n"}}

Completion validation:\n   - Verify all required tasks are completed\n   - Check that implemented features match the original specification\n   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements\n   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan\n   - Report final status with summary of completed work\n\nNote: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/speckit.tasks` first to regenerate the task list.\n","images":[]}}

See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.\n\n## Summary\n\nDeliver a production-ready, editorial travel discovery experience with four\ncore routes (home, destinations index, destination detail, about), curated local\nseed data, client-side filtering/sorting, and localStorage-backed reviews. The\nimplementation follows App Router conventions, uses shadcn/ui primitives for\nall UI foundations, and includes loading, empty, and not-found states with\nresponsive layout and accessibility checks.\n\n## Technical Context\n\n**Language/Version**: TypeScript (strict)  \n**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js (latest stable, App Router), Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui  \n**Storage**: Local seed data module + localStorage (reviews)  \n**Testing**: Manual QA (no automated tests requested)  \n**Target Platform**: Modern evergreen browsers (desktop + mobile)  \n**Project Type**: Web app (frontend-only)  \n**Performance Goals**: Primary content visible within 2s on broadband; smooth\nfiltering and tab transitions  \n**Constraints**: No backend, no external APIs, run-ready with `npm install` and\n`npm run dev`  \n**Scale/Scope**: 4 routes, 12+ destinations, local reviews persisted per\nDestination\n\n## Constitution Check\n\n*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*\n\n- Stack matches Next.js (latest stable, App Router), TypeScript (strict),\n  Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui\n- MCP context7 is the source of truth for Next.js, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui\n- App Router is used; Pages Router is not used\n- shadcn/ui primitives are used for applicable UI elements and composed into\n  sections/domain components\n- Component layout follows `components/ui`, `components/sections`,\n  `components/domain`\n- Destination data uses local seed data; reviews persist via localStorage\n- Spec exists and uses the spec template with prioritized, independently\n  testable user stories\n- Requirements are testable and traceable to at least one user story\n- If tests are requested, test tasks are listed before implementation tasks\n- Tasks reference explicit file paths and story/requirement identifiers\n- Any complexity exceptions are justified in the Complexity Tracking section\n\n**Gate status**: PASS\n\n## Project Structure\n\n### Documentation (this feature)\n\n```text\nspecs/001-travel-discovery-reviews/\n├── plan.md\n├── research.md\n├── data-model.md\n├── quickstart.md\n├── contracts/\n│   └── destinations-api.yaml\n└── tasks.md\n```\n\n### Source Code (repository root)\n\n```text\napp/\n├── layout.tsx\n├── page.tsx\n├── loading.tsx\n├── not-found.tsx\n├── about/\n│   └── page.tsx\n├── destinations/\n│   ├── page.tsx\n│   ├── loading.tsx\n│   └── [slug]/\n│       ├── page.tsx\n│       ├── loading.tsx\n│       └── not-found.tsx\n\ncomponents/\n├── ui/              # shadcn/ui primitives\n├── sections/        # home + index sections\n└── domain/          # destination + review components\n\ndata/\n└── destinations.ts\n\nlib/\n├── filters.ts\n├── reviews.ts\n├── storage.ts\n└── format.ts\n\npublic/\n└── images/\n```\n\n**Structure Decision**: Single Next.js App Router project with shared sections\nand domain components. Loading and not-found files exist at root and for dynamic\nroute segments where needed.\n\n## Implementation Steps\n\n### 1) Project initialization (context7-backed)\n\n- Create the project with `npx create-next-app@latest` (Next.js docs) and\n  select:\n  - TypeScript: Yes\n  - App Router: Yes\n  - Tailwind CSS: Yes\n  - ESLint: Yes\n- Initialize shadcn/ui with `npx shadcn@latest init` (shadcn/ui CLI docs).\n- Add required shadcn/ui components using the CLI:\n  - `npx shadcn@latest add button card badge tabs accordion dialog input select separator skeleton toast`\n\n### 2) Data and state flow design\n\n- Seed destinations from `data/destinations.ts` and expose helpers in\n  `lib/filters.ts` for search, filter, and sort.\n- Apply filters/sort client-side in the destinations index and in any shared\n  discovery sections.\n- Store reviews in localStorage keyed by `destinationSlug` using\n  `lib/storage.ts` and `lib/reviews.ts` helpers.\n- Derive ratingAverage and reviewCount by combining seed rating with user\n  reviews. Plan:\n  - Seed ratingAverage/reviewCount represent baseline editorial rating.\n  - On render, merge baseline + user reviews to compute displayed values.\n  - Destination detail reads merged values for metadata, badges, and cards.\n\n### 3) Route-level implementation\n\n- `/` (Home): hero + search, trending grid, top-rated row, travel guide teaser,\n  newsletter CTA. Use `components/sections/*` for modular layout.\n- `/destinations`: search input, region/tag filters, sort control, results grid\n  using shadcn Card, Skeletons on load, empty state when no results.\n- `/destinations/[slug]`: cover image (local placeholder), metadata, highlights,\n  Tabs for Overview/Reviews/Travel Guide, review list, review dialog form with\n  validation, FAQ accordion, not-found for invalid slug.\n- `/about`: editorial mission and methodology.\n\n### 4) UI composition and primitives\n\n- Use shadcn/ui for Button, Card, Badge, Tabs, Accordion, Dialog, Input, Select,\n  Separator, Skeleton, and toast across all applicable UI.\n- Compose primitives into `components/domain` for DestinationCard, ReviewCard,\n  ReviewFormDialog, and filter controls.\n\n### 5) Metadata and images (context7-backed)\n\n- Define static metadata for static routes via `export const metadata`.\n- Use `generateMetadata` for destination detail pages based on slug.\n- Use `next/image` with explicit `width`/`height` for local or remote images.\n\n### 6) Quality gates and checks\n\n- Accessibility: labels for inputs, keyboard navigation for Tabs/Dialog, focus\n  trapping in dialog, and semantic headings.\n- States: loading for `/`, `/destinations`, `/destinations/[slug]`; empty states\n  for filters; not-found for invalid slugs.\n- Responsive: verify hero, grids, tabs, review form, and CTA sections across\n  mobile/tablet/desktop breakpoints.\n\n## Definition of Done\n\n- [ ] `npm install` and `npm run dev` succeed with no missing configs\n- [ ] All routes render correctly: `/`, `/destinations`, `/destinations/[slug]`, `/about`\n- [ ] Filters and sorting work client-side on destinations index\n- [ ] Reviews can be submitted and persist across reloads (localStorage)\n- [ ] Loading, empty, and not-found states are present and functional\n- [ ] UI is polished, cohesive, and editorial (non-generic)\n- [ ] No broken links or runtime errors\n- [ ] Accessibility checks pass (labels, keyboard nav, dialog focus)\n\n## Complexity Tracking\n\n> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**\n\n| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |\n|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|\n"}}
