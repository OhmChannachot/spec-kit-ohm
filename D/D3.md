Create an implementation plan that follows the Constitution + Spec exactly.

Plan requirements:
1) Use MCP context7 as source of truth for:
   - create-next-app@latest options (App Router + TS)
   - Tailwind setup in Next.js
   - shadcn/ui init + adding components
2) Include a precise file/folder architecture:
   - app/ routes (/, /destinations, /destinations/[slug], /about)
   - app/(route)/loading.tsx and not-found.tsx where needed
   - components/ui (shadcn primitives)
   - components/sections (home sections)
   - components/domain (destinations + reviews)
   - data/ (destinations seed)
   - lib/ (filter/sort utils, storage, formatting)
3) Specify which shadcn components will be added (minimum):
   - button, card, badge, tabs, accordion, dialog, input, select, separator, skeleton, toast
4) Explicitly plan the state/data flow:
   - destinations loaded from local data module
   - filters/sort performed client-side
   - reviews stored in localStorage keyed by destinationSlug
   - derived rating and reviewCount behavior (seed vs user reviews)
5) Add quality gates:
   - accessibility checks (labels, keyboard navigation, dialog focus)
   - loading/empty/not-found states
   - responsive breakpoints for key sections
6) End the plan with a “Definition of Done” checklist matching acceptance criteria.
