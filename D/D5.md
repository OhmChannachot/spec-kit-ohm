Implement strictly according to the Constitution + Spec + Plan + Tasks.

Implementation rules (non-negotiable):
1) Use MCP context7 for any of the following:
   - Next.js App Router APIs (metadata, loading.tsx, not-found.tsx)
   - Tailwind config and usage guidance
   - shadcn init and component generation
   - next/image usage
2) Do not leave any TODOs, placeholder imports, or broken paths.
3) The repo MUST run at the end with:
   - `npm install`
   - `npm run dev`

Implementation deliverables:
A) Bootstrap:
   - Generate Next.js app in this repo via create-next-app@latest (App Router + TS).
   - Configure Tailwind correctly.
   - Initialize shadcn and add these components:
     button, card, badge, tabs, accordion, dialog, input, select, separator, skeleton, toast

B) App shell:
   - app/layout.tsx with global layout, fonts (system or next/font), header/nav/footer
   - consistent container + spacing utilities

C) Data + utilities:
   - data/destinations.ts with >= 12 destinations
   - lib/filterSort.ts for search/filter/sort
   - lib/storage.ts for localStorage get/set (safe for SSR)
   - lib/format.ts for dates/ratings

D) Routes:
   - Home /: hero + search + trending + top-rated + guides + newsletter CTA
   - /destinations: filters UI (Input, Select, Badge toggles), results grid, load-more/pagination
   - /destinations/[slug]: tabs (overview/reviews/guide), review list, review dialog form w/ validation,
     localStorage persistence, FAQ accordion, gallery
   - /about: simple page with metadata

E) UX states:
   - loading.tsx skeletons for destinations and detail pages
   - not-found.tsx for invalid slugs
   - empty state when filters yield no results
   - toast on review submit success/error

F) Final polish pass:
   - ensure consistent typography scale and spacing
   - refine card styles, hover, focus rings
   - verify mobile layout for each route
   - remove unused code

G) Final verification:
   - run build/dev checks (at least ensure `npm run dev` works)
   - quick manual smoke test: navigate pages and submit a review then refresh.
