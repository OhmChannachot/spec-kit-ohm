Generate tasks as a strict, ordered checklist that can be executed sequentially.

Task requirements:
1) Every task must be:
   - atomic (one primary outcome)
   - verifiable (clear check)
   - mapped to specific files/commands
2) Include exact setup commands (verified via MCP context7):
   - create-next-app@latest
   - shadcn init
   - shadcn add components list
3) Organize tasks into phases:
   Phase A: Project bootstrap + configs (Next.js + Tailwind + shadcn)
   Phase B: Shared UI + layout shell (Header/Nav/Footer)
   Phase C: Data + utilities (destinations seed, filtering utils, localStorage helpers)
   Phase D: Routes (Home, Destinations list, Destination detail, About)
   Phase E: UX states (loading, empty, not-found, error boundaries if used)
   Phase F: Polish (typography scale, spacing, responsive tune, icons, toasts)
   Phase G: Final verification (run dev, fix lint, smoke test navigation)
4) For each route, include tasks for:
   - responsive layout
   - skeleton loading
   - empty state
   - SEO metadata
5) Add a final “Release checklist” task:
   - npm install
   - npm run dev
   - navigate all routes
   - submit a review and refresh page to confirm persistence
