Build a complete, visually polished travel discovery and review website with a modern editorial / travel-magazine aesthetic.

This is a frontend-only application, but it must feel production-ready.

## Technology
- Next.js latest stable (App Router) — verify all APIs via MCP context7
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS — verify configuration via MCP context7
- shadcn/ui — verify install and component usage via MCP context7

## Non-Negotiable Constraints
1) Use MCP context7 as the source of truth for Next.js, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui.
2) Do not hallucinate APIs, configs, or file structures.
3) The final output MUST be runnable immediately:
   - `npm install` then `npm run dev`
   - All required configs included
4) The project MUST be created via `create-next-app@latest`.

## Product Vision
A curated travel discovery platform that showcases destinations with ratings, reviews, highlights, and editorial presentation—clean, inspiring, and easy to explore.

Include at least 12 destinations across regions.

### Review

- createdAt

## UI & UX Rules
- Use shadcn components consistently:
  - Card, Badge, Tabs, Accordion, Dialog, Button, Input, Select, Skeleton, toast
- Layout must be responsive and mobile-first.
- Typography must use readable max widths and clear hierarchy.
- Provide:
  - Loading states
  - Empty states
  - Error/not-found states

## Technical Requirements
- Follow App Router conventions:
  - `app/layout.tsx`
  - `app/page.tsx`
  - `loading.tsx`
  - `not-found.tsx`
- Use `next/image` correctly (verify via MCP context7).
- Implement page-level metadata (title, description, Open Graph).
- Organize code:
  - `app/`
  - `components/`
  - `lib/`
  - `data/`

## Acceptance Criteria
- `npm install` + `npm run dev` works
- All routes render correctly
- Filters and review submission work
- Reviews persist across reloads
- UI looks polished, cohesive, and non-generic
- No broken links or runtime errors
