Project Constitution (Non-Negotiable Rules)

## Stack
- Next.js (latest stable) using App Router
- TypeScript (strict)
- Tailwind CSS
- shadcn/ui (Radix-based components)

## MCP & Documentation
- MCP server context7 MUST be used as the source of truth for:
  - Next.js APIs and App Router conventions
  - Tailwind CSS setup and configuration
  - shadcn/ui installation and component usage
- APIs, configs, or patterns MUST NOT be guessed or hallucinated.

## Project Initialization
- The project MUST be created using `create-next-app@latest`.
- App Router MUST be used (no Pages Router).
- Tailwind MUST be initialized via official Next.js + Tailwind integration.
- shadcn/ui MUST be initialized via `npx shadcn@latest init`.

## UI & Design Quality
- Visual style MUST be modern, premium, and editorial (travel magazine feel).
- Strong typography hierarchy: hero → section titles → body.
- Generous whitespace and consistent spacing scale.
- Color usage MUST be restrained and harmonious.
- Motion MUST be subtle and purposeful (hover, focus, light transitions).

## Component Rules
- shadcn/ui components MUST be used for all applicable UI primitives:
  - Button, Card, Badge, Tabs, Accordion, Dialog, Input, Select, Separator, Skeleton, toast.
- Custom components MUST compose shadcn primitives rather than replace them.
- Component structure:
  - `components/ui` → shadcn primitives
  - `components/sections` → page sections
  - `components/domain` → travel/destination-specific components

## Data & State
- No external backend required.
- Use local seed data for destinations.
- User-generated reviews MUST persist via localStorage.
- Client-side state MUST be predictable and clean.

## Quality & DX
- The output MUST be immediately runnable:
  - `npm install`
  - `npm run dev`
- No missing configs, TODOs, or broken imports.
- Accessibility MUST be respected (semantic HTML, keyboard navigation).
- Code MUST be readable, modular, and maintainable.
