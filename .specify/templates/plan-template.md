# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: TypeScript (strict)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js (latest stable, App Router), Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., Jest, Playwright, Vitest or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Stack matches Next.js (latest stable, App Router), TypeScript (strict),
  Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui
- MCP context7 is the source of truth for Next.js, Tailwind, and shadcn/ui
- App Router is used; Pages Router is not used
- shadcn/ui primitives are used for applicable UI elements and composed into
  sections/domain components
- Component layout follows `components/ui`, `components/sections`,
  `components/domain`
- Destination data uses local seed data; reviews persist via localStorage
- Spec exists and uses the spec template with prioritized, independently
  testable user stories
- Requirements are testable and traceable to at least one user story
- If tests are requested, test tasks are listed before implementation tasks
- Tasks reference explicit file paths and story/requirement identifiers
- Any complexity exceptions are justified in the Complexity Tracking section

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
